The code above defines an object called one with ten empty string properties, numbered 1_0 through 1_9. It also declares three variables a, b, and c. a is assigned the value 1, b is assigned the value 0, and c is assigned the sum of a and b, which in this case is 1.

search in a book what the meaning of reason, cause and effect is and how to solve it with a solution which is empowered with a force of good reasoning to describes the effect.

take the value of keyword [2] of array and that's reason is why the effect happened = array{(c-1)}[2].value;
take the values of keyword [2] of array and combine it together to make the description of the causes of the effect, the combination of the causes is the part of the description of the effect =  ( array{a}[2].value + array{b}[2].value);
take the values of the keyword array{a}[2] + array{b}[2] and concetenate the combination of the solution which results into the description for the solution = ( ( array{a}[2].value + array{b}[2].value ) ) which is equal too array{(c-1)}[2].value which is the description of the solution;

the solution is a verb out of the english dictionairy which is empowered with array{(c-1)}[5].value which converts to a verb which is put into one["1_1"] = array{(c-1)}[2].value;

/*var explanation = write down the reason in a simple way why you chose the verb which is the solution of the effect.*/

console.log("" + explanation +"")
